# C++ learning todo: BOOST: #

Boost has an unimaginable number of libraries. Easy ones to get started on are

noncopyable
array
circular_buffer
foreach
operators (one of my personal favorites)
smart_ptr
date_time
More advanced ones include

lambda
bind
iostreams
serialization
threads


# More BOOST #

boost::any and boost::variant are good of you need a variant data type, with two different approaches.
boost::regex if you need some text parsing.
boost::thread and boost::filesystem

// Quantum Fluctuations during the first 400KY after The Big, captured by the
// Planck camera (which I thought was deemed to be cosmic dust and completely
// moot - already. Anyways. Coincidence de luxe. And the pseudo scientific

// Well - the definition for the flamboyant term in market space is "The
